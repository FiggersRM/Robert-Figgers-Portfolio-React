        Hello, my name is Robert Figgers, but I go by Mitch. I am a 27 year old
        male who currently works in the service industry, specifically at a
        restaurant named Lunch and Supper, located in Scott's Addition in
        Richmond. I am in the process of completing the University of Richmond
        web development bootcamp, and hope to start my work in the field when
        that is completed. Previously, I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth
        University with a degree in business and a focus on real estate. As much
        as I enjoyed learning about that, I decided it ultimately wasn't for me.
        After building a computer in late 2021, I decided technology is what I
        was passionate about. I decided to start the web devlopment bootcamp in
        early 2023 and have since learned both front-end and back-end
        development skills. Even though I still have much to learn, I am excited
        about where the field will take me in my career. I feel like the
        possibilities are endless and I am alwaysa excited to learn a new
        concept when it comes to coding.

        As for my personal life, I was born and raised in Fredericksburg,
        Virginia. After graduating high school, I decided to move to Richmond
        for school. I fell in love with this city, and have been here since the
        Fall of 2014. I am a fairly social person who enjoys a variety of
        different things and stepping out of my comfort zone to try new ones. My
        friends and family are essential to me, so any time I can see them I
        like doing so. Myself and my three siblings all have a very close bond
        with each other and our parents, and I am fortunate that they all live
        in the same city that I do. My friends allow me to try different things
        that I wouldn't normally, because everyone comes from a different
        background. As for hobbies, I have a variety of different interests.
        Some of those include all sports: mainly any Washington sports team as
        well as tennis, amusement parks, visiting new restaurants, and video
        games. Although as I said, I love to try new things to get a variety of
        activities in my life.
